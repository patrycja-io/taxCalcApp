# tax-calc-app

> A simple tax calculator 
Used option 1 - Front-end with Vue.js. (NEVER USED THIS FRAMEWORK BEFORE :/)

I am affraid that I run of a time - Wanted badly to use Vue.js for the first time as this is the framework used in Igloo.
Couple bugs occured - UI doesnt show at all.
But please check my code.

## Build Setup


cd to tax-calc-app

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
